  abstract = "Congenital heart defects (CHD) arise in part due to inherited
              genetic variants that alter genes and noncoding regulatory
              elements in the human genome. These variants are thought to act
              during fetal development to influence the formation of different
              heart structures. However, identifying the genes, pathways, and
              cell types that mediate these effects has been challenging due to
              the immense diversity of cell types involved in heart development
              as well as the superimposed complexities of interpreting noncoding
              sequences. As such, understanding the molecular functions of both
              noncoding and coding variants remains paramount to our fundamental
              understanding of cardiac development and CHD. Here, we created a
              gene regulation map of the healthy human fetal heart across
              developmental time, and applied it to interpret the functions of
              variants associated with CHD and quantitative cardiac traits. We
              collected single-cell multiomic data from 734,000 single cells
              sampled from 41 fetal hearts spanning post-conception weeks 6 to
              22, enabling the construction of gene regulation maps in 90
              cardiac cell types and states, including rare populations of
              cardiac conduction cells. Through an unbiased analysis of all 90
              cell types, we find that both rare coding variants associated with
              CHD and common noncoding variants associated with valve traits
              converge to affect valvular interstitial cells (VICs). VICs are
              enriched for high expression of known CHD genes previously
              identified through mapping of rare coding variants. Eight CHD
              genes, as well as other genes in similar molecular pathways, are
              linked to common noncoding variants associated with other valve
              diseases or traits via enhancers in VICs. In addition, certain
              common noncoding variants impact enhancers with activities highly
              specific to particular subanatomic structures in the heart,
              illuminating how such variants can impact specific aspects of
              heart structure and function. Together, these results implicate
              new enhancers, genes, and cell types in the genetic etiology of
              CHD, identify molecular convergence of common noncoding and rare
              coding variants on VICs, and suggest a more expansive view of the
              cell types instrumental in genetic risk for CHD, beyond the
              working cardiomyocyte. This regulatory map of the human fetal
              heart will provide a foundational resource for understanding

  abstract = "AbstractAlthough genome wide association studies (GWAS) in large
              populations have identified hundreds of variants associated with
              common diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), most
              disease-associated variants lie within non-coding regions of the
              genome, rendering it difficult to determine the downstream causal
              gene and cell type. Here, we performed paired single nucleus gene
              expression and chromatin accessibility profiling from 44 human
              coronary arteries. To link disease variants to molecular traits,
              we developed a meta-map of 88 samples and discovered 11,182
              single-cell chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci
              (caQTLs). Heritability enrichment analysis and disease variant
              mapping demonstrated that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harbor the
              greatest genetic risk for CAD. To capture the continuum of SMC
              cell states in disease, we used dynamic single cell caQTL modeling
              for the first time in tissue to uncover QTLs whose effects are
              modified by cell state and expand our insight into genetic
              regulation of heterogenous cell populations. Notably, we
              identified a variant in theCOL4A1/COL4A2CAD GWAS locus which
              becomes a caQTL as SMCs de-differentiate by changing a
              transcription factor binding site for EGR1/2. To unbiasedly
              prioritize functional candidate genes, we built a genome-wide
              single cell variant to enhancer to gene (scV2E2G) map for human
              CAD to link disease variants to causal genes in cell types. Using
              this approach, we found several hundred genes predicted to be
              linked to disease variants in different cell types. Next, we
              performed genome-wide Hi-C in 16 human coronary arteries to build
              tissue specific maps of chromatin conformation and link disease
              variants to integrated chromatin hubs and distal target genes.
              Using this approach, we show that rs4887091 within theADAMTS7CAD
              GWAS locus modulates function of a super chromatin interactome
              through a change in a CTCF binding site. Finally, we used CRISPR
              interference to validate a distal gene,AMOTL2, liked to a CAD GWAS
              locus. Collectively we provide a disease-agnostic framework to
              translate human genetic findings to identify pathologic cell
              states and genes driving disease, producing a comprehensive
              scV2E2G map with genetic and tissue level convergence for future
              mechanistic and therapeutic studies.",

              promoters. In addition, MYC has also been shown to invade distal
              enhancers when expressed at oncogenic levels, but this enhancer
              binding has been proposed to have low gene-regulatory potential.

              through recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), rather than
              regulating RNAPII pause-release, as is the case at promoters. This

               becoming a global health challenge without effective treatments.
               Defective mitochondrial function and mitophagy have recently been
               suggested as etiological factors in AD, in association with
               abnormalities in components of the autophagic machinery like
               lysosomes and phagosomes. Several large transcriptomic studies
               have been performed on different brain regions from AD and
               healthy patients, and their data represent a vast source of
               important information that can be utilized to understand this
               condition. However, large integration analyses of these publicly
               available data, such as AD RNA-Seq data, are still missing. In
               addition, large-scale focused analysis on mitophagy, which seems
               to be relevant for the aetiology of the disease, has not yet been
               performed. Methods: In this study, publicly available raw RNA-Seq
               data generated from healthy control and sporadic AD post-mortem
               human samples of the brain frontal lobe were collected and
               integrated. Sex-specific differential expression analysis was
               performed on the combined data set after batch effect correction.
               From the resulting set of differentially expressed genes,
               candidate mitophagy-related genes were identified based on their
               known functional roles in mitophagy, the lysosome, or the
               phagosome, followed by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and
               microRNA-mRNA network analysis. The expression changes of
               candidate genes were further validated in human skin fibroblast
               and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived cortical
               neurons from AD patients and matching healthy controls. Results:
               From a large dataset (AD: 589; control: 246) based on three
               different datasets (i.e., ROSMAP, MSBB, \& GSE110731), we
               identified 299 candidate mitophagy-related differentially
               expressed genes (DEG) in sporadic AD patients (male: 195, female:
               188). Among these, the AAA ATPase VCP, the GTPase ARF1, the
               autophagic vesicle forming protein GABARAPL1 and the cytoskeleton
               protein actin beta ACTB were selected based on network degrees
               and existing literature. Changes in their expression were further
               validated in AD-relevant human in vitro models, which confirmed
               their down-regulation in AD conditions. Conclusion: Through the
               joint analysis of multiple publicly available data sets, we
               identify four differentially expressed key mitophagy-related
               genes potentially relevant for the pathogenesis of sporadic AD.
               Changes in expression of these four genes were validated using
               two AD-relevant human in vitro models, primary human fibroblasts
               and iPSC-derived neurons. Our results provide foundation for
               further investigation of these genes as potential biomarkers or
               disease-modifying pharmacological targets.",

              between species in the gene expression program in each cell type,
              but may also reflect differences in cell type composition of each
              tissue in different species. Here, we compare expression profiles
              in matching primary cells in human, mouse, rat, dog, and chicken
              using Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) and short RNA (sRNA)
              sequencing data from FANTOM5. While we find that expression
              profiles of orthologous genes in different species are highly
              correlated across cell types, in each cell type many genes were
              differentially expressed between species. Expression of genes with
              products involved in transcription, RNA processing, and
              transcriptional regulation was more likely to be conserved, while
              expression of genes encoding proteins involved in intercellular
              communication was more likely to have diverged during evolution.
              Conservation of expression correlated positively with the
              evolutionary age of genes, suggesting that divergence in
              expression levels of genes critical for cell function was
              restricted during evolution. Motif activity analysis showed that
              both promoters and enhancers are activated by the same
              transcription factors in different species. An analysis of
              expression levels of mature miRNAs and of primary miRNAs
              identified by CAGE revealed that evolutionary old miRNAs are more
              likely to have conserved expression patterns than young miRNAs. We
              conclude that key aspects of the regulatory network are conserved,
              while differential expression of genes involved in cell-to-cell

              myristate acetate (PMA) over 96 hours. PMA treatment greatly
              reduced the numbers of cells entering S phase and also blocked
              cells exiting G2/M. The PMA-treated cells became adherent and
              expression of mature macrophage-specific genes increased
              progressively over the duration of the time course. Within 1-2
              hours PMA induced known targets of tumour protein p53 (TP53),
              notably CDKN1A, followed by gradual down-regulation of cell-cycle
              associated genes. Also within the first 2 hours, PMA induced
              immediate early genes including transcription factor genes
              encoding proteins implicated in macrophage differentiation (EGR2,

               Expression (CAGE) in particular, have been instrumental in
               studying transcriptional regulation. 5'-end methods provide
               genome-wide maps of transcription start sites (TSSs) with base
               pair resolution. Because active enhancers often feature
               bidirectional TSSs, such data can also be used to predict
               enhancer candidates. The current availability of mature and
               comprehensive computational tools for the analysis of 5'-end data
               is limited, preventing efficient analysis of new and existing
               5'-end data. RESULTS: We present CAGEfightR, a framework for
               analysis of CAGE and other 5'-end data implemented as an
               R/Bioconductor-package. CAGEfightR can import data from BigWig
               files and allows for fast and memory efficient prediction and
               analysis of TSSs and enhancers. Downstream analyses include
               quantification, normalization, annotation with transcript and
               gene models, TSS shape statistics, linking TSSs to enhancers via
               co-expression, identification of enhancer clusters, and
               genome-browser style visualization. While built to analyze CAGE
               data, we demonstrate the utility of CAGEfightR in analyzing
               nascent RNA 5'-data (PRO-Cap). CAGEfightR is implemented using
               standard Bioconductor classes, making it easy to learn, use and
               combine with other Bioconductor packages, for example popular
               differential expression tools such as limma, DESeq2 and edgeR.
               CONCLUSIONS: CAGEfightR provides a single, scalable and
               easy-to-use framework for comprehensive downstream analysis of
               5'-end data. CAGEfightR is designed to be interoperable with
               other Bioconductor packages, thereby unlocking hundreds of mature
               transcriptomic analysis tools for 5'-end data. CAGEfightR is

              sister chromatids inherit modified histones evenly remains

               expression was quantified across all human FANTOM5 libraries,
               following the re-aligned FANTOM5 CAGE data upon mm10 (GRCm38)
               (obtained from

               Hideya. Description Transcribed enhancers were called based on
               bidirectional balanced RNA signatures as per Andersson et al
               (2014). Enhancers were only identified distal to known exons
               (+/-100bp region from boundaries) and transcription start sites
               (+/-300bp), defined by GENCODE vM7 annotation. In total, 44,138
               enhancers were identified across 1,068 libraries and the
               expression was quantified. For details regarding the
               identification of transcribed enhancers from CAGE data, please
               see Andersson et al (2014) and blog post. Due to varying noise
               levels across FANTOM5 libraries and the intrinsic low expression
               levels of transcribed enhancers, library-specific noise levels
               were estimated to define of robust set of enhancers in each
               sample. In summary, for each library, expression was quantified
               in randomly sampled genomic regions distal to assembly gaps,
               DNase hypersensitive sites (ENCODE), known exons and gene TSSs
               (GENCODE vM7) to create a genomic background expression
               distribution. For each library, we called an enhancer active
               (used) if its expression was above the 99.9th quantile of the
               libraryâs genomic background expression distribution. The robust
               set of enhancers consist of those significantly expressed in at
               least one library. While this approach ensures less permissive
               enhancer calling in noisy libraries, for some libraries the noise
               threshold is zero meaning that a single CAGE tag is sufficient
               for calling an enhancer active. Furthermore, the possibility of
               detecting enhancer transcription is affected by sequencing depth,
               so the number of active enhancers per library might not be
               biologically meaningful to compare when sequencing depths differ.

              the unifying architecture is conserved across Metazoa. Here we
              investigate the transcription initiation landscape and its
              associated RNA decay in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that the
              majority of active gene-distal enhancers and a considerable
              fraction of gene promoters are divergently transcribed. We observe
              quantitative relationships between enhancer potential, expression
              level and core promoter strength, providing an explanation for
              indirectly related histone modifications that are reflecting

              weak core promoters are key characteristics of gene-distal
              developmental enhancers, while the housekeeping enhancer strengths
              of gene promoters reflect their expression strengths. The

              susceptibility, are enriched within the transcriptional regulatory
              elements, promoters and enhancers. There is emerging evidence that
              regulatory elements associated with particular traits or diseases
              share similar patterns of transcriptional activity. Accordingly,
              shared transcriptional activity (coexpression) may help prioritise
              loci associated with a given trait, and help to identify
              underlying biological processes. Using cap analysis of gene
              expression (CAGE) profiles of promoter- and enhancer-derived RNAs
              across 1824 human samples, we have analysed coexpression of RNAs
              originating from trait-associated regulatory regions using a novel
              quantitative method (network density analysis; NDA). For most
              traits studied, phenotype-associated variants in regulatory
              regions were linked to tightly-coexpressed networks that are
              likely to share important functional characteristics. Coexpression
              provides a new signal, independent of phenotype association, to
              enable fine mapping of causative variants. The NDA coexpression
              approach identifies new genetic variants associated with specific
              traits, including an association between the regulation of the
              OCT1 cation transporter and genetic variants underlying
              circulating cholesterol levels. NDA strongly implicates particular
              cell types and tissues in disease pathogenesis. For example,
              distinct groupings of disease-associated regulatory regions
              implicate two distinct biological processes in the pathogenesis of
              ulcerative colitis; a further two separate processes are
              implicated in Crohnâs disease. Thus, our functional analysis of
              genetic predisposition to disease defines new distinct disease
              endotypes. We predict that patients with a preponderance of
              susceptibility variants in each group are likely to respond
              differently to pharmacological therapy. Together, these findings
              enable a deeper biological understanding of the causal basis of

              upstream transcripts (PROMPTs). Although PROMPTs are commonly

              potential for gene disruption and genomic takeover if not kept in
              check. Paradoxically, although host cells repress these elements
              by multiple mechanisms, they are transcribed and are even
              activated under stress conditions. Here, we describe a new
              mechanism of retrotransposon regulation through transcription
              start site (TSS) selection by altered nucleosome occupancy. We
              show that Fun30 chromatin remodelers cooperate to maintain a high
              level of nucleosome occupancy at retrotransposon-flanking long
              terminal repeat (LTR) elements. This enforces the use of a
              downstream TSS and the production of a truncated RNA incapable of
              reverse transcription and retrotransposition. However, in stressed
              cells, nucleosome occupancy at LTR elements is reduced, and the
              TSS shifts to allow for productive transcription. We propose that
              controlled retrotransposon transcription from a nonproductive TSS
              allows for rapid stress-induced activation, while preventing
              uncontrolled transposon activity in the genome.",

              deacetylases (HDACs), has proven to be effective in recapitulating
              juvenile plasticity in the mature visual cortex (V1). We
              investigated the chromatin structure and transcriptional control
              by genome-wide sequencing of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSS)
              and cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) libraries after HDAC
              inhibition by valproic acid (VPA) in adult V1. RESULTS:We found
              that VPA reliably reactivates the critical period plasticity and
              induces a dramatic change of chromatin organization in V1 yielding
              significantly greater accessibility distant from promoters,
              including at enhancer regions. VPA also induces nucleosome
              eviction specifically from retrotransposon (in particular SINE)
              elements. The transiently accessible SINE elements overlap with
              transcription factor-binding sites of the Fox family. Mapping of
              transcription start site activity using CAGE revealed
              transcription of epigenetic and neural plasticity-regulating genes
              following VPA treatment, which may help to re-program the genomic
              landscape and reactivate plasticity in the adult cortex.
              CONCLUSIONS:Treatment with HDAC inhibitors increases accessibility
              to enhancers and repetitive elements underlying brain-specific

               all steps in transcriptional regulation, from transcription
               factor (TF) binding to messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)
               synthesis. Careful profiling of their locations and dynamics in
               response to stimuli is important to further our understanding of
               transcriptional regulation by the state of chromatin. We measured
               nucleosome occupancy in human hepatic cells before and after
               treatment with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFÎ²1), using
               massively parallel sequencing. With a newly developed method,
               SuMMIt, for precise positioning of nucleosomes we inferred
               dynamics of the nucleosomal landscape. Distinct nucleosome
               positioning has previously been described at transcription start
               site and flanking TF binding sites. We found that the average
               pattern is present at very few sites and, in case of TF binding,
               the double peak surrounding the sites is just an artifact of
               averaging over many loci. We systematically searched for depleted
               nucleosomes in stimulated cells compared to unstimulated cells
               and identified 24 318 loci. Depending on genomic annotation,
               44-78\% of them were over-represented in binding motifs for TFs.
               Changes in binding affinity were verified for HNF4Î± by qPCR.
               Strikingly many of these loci were associated with expression
               changes, as measured by RNA sequencing.",

              express the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), are
              engaged in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and
              homeostasis. By transcriptional start site cluster analysis, we
              assessed here how genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation or Foxp3
              binding sites were associated with Treg-specific gene expression.
              We found that Treg-specific DNA hypomethylated regions were
              closely associated with Treg up-regulated transcriptional start
              site clusters, whereas Foxp3 binding regions had no significant
              correlation with either up- or down-regulated clusters in
              nonactivated Treg cells. However, in activated Treg cells, Foxp3
              binding regions showed a strong correlation with down-regulated
              clusters. In accordance with these findings, the above two
              features of activation-dependent gene regulation in Treg cells
              tend to occur at different locations in the genome. The results
              collectively indicate that Treg-specific DNA hypomethylation is
              instrumental in gene up-regulation in steady state Treg cells,
              whereas Foxp3 down-regulates the expression of its target genes in
              activated Treg cells. Thus, the two events seem to play distinct
              but complementary roles in Treg-specific gene expression.",

               whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed
               of several closely separated TSSs, with independent
               cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to
               different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters

               characterized by the development of both benign and malignant
               tumors. The lifetime risk for developing a malignant peripheral
               nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) in NF1 patients is approximately 10\%

               loss of one copy of the NF1 gene and copy number polymorphisms,
               no other changes were found. The profiles of malignant samples,

               lack of correct contacts, and in particular long-range contacts,
               is considered the main reason why these methods often fail.
               RESULTS: We propose a novel hidden Markov model (HMM)-based
               method for predicting residue-residue contacts from protein
               sequences using as training data homologous sequences, predicted
               secondary structure and a library of local neighborhoods (local
               descriptors of protein structure). The library consists of
               recurring structural entities incorporating short-, medium- and
               long-range interactions and is general enough to reassemble the
               cores of nearly all proteins in the PDB. The method is tested on
               an external test set of 606 domains with no significant sequence
               similarity to the training set as well as 151 domains with SCOP
               folds not present in the training set. Considering the top 0.2 x
               L predictions (L = sequence length), our HMMs obtained an
               accuracy of 22.8\% for long-range interactions in new fold

              hypermethylated in CRC, while ES H3K27me3 was also common in genes

               in the human genome, we assessed copy number variations (CNVs) in
               a series of 71 healthy subjects from three ethnic groups. CNVs
               were analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to a

               autosomal CNVs, including at least two neighboring/overlapping
               BACs, which represent 315 distinct regions. The average size of

               CNVs, recognized with various platforms. However, results from
               chromosome X do not agree well with the previously annotated
               CNVs. Furthermore, data from single BACs deviating in copy number
               suggest that our above estimate of total variation is
               conservative. This report contributes to the establishment of the
               common baseline for CNV, which is an important resource in human
               genetics.",

               has been recognized on the basis of common clinical disorders
               such as the DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DG/VCFs). Recent
               evidence has implicated low-copy repeats (LCRs); also known as
               segmental duplications; on 22q as mediators of nonallelic
               homologous recombination (NAHR) that result in rearrangements of
               22q11.2. It has been shown that both deletion and duplication
               events can occur as a result of NAHR caused by unequal crossover
               of LCRs. Here we report on the clinical, cytogenetic and array
               CGH studies of a 15-year-old Hispanic boy with history of
               learning and behavior problems. We suggest that he represents a
               previously unrecognized microdeletion syndrome on chromosome 22
               band q11.2 just telomeric to the DG/VCFs typically deleted region
               and encompassing the BCR gene. Using a 32K BAC array CGH chip we
               were able to refine and precisely narrow the breakpoints of this
               microdeletion, which was estimated to be 1.55-1.92 Mb in size and
               to span approximately 20 genes. This microdeletion region is
               flanked by LCR clusters containing several modules with a very
               high degree of sequence homology (>95\%), and therefore could
               play a causal role in its origin.",

               chromosomal rearrangement, consisting of a terminal deletion of
               4p and a paternal duplication of terminal 11p. Each of these is
               associated with the well-known clinical phenotypes of
               Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
               (BWS), respectively. She presented for clinical evaluation of
               dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, atrial septal
               defect (ASD), and left hydronephrosis. High-resolution
               cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal female karyotype, but
               subtelomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis
               revealed a der(4)t(4;11)(pter;pter). Both FISH and microarray CGH
               studies clearly demonstrated that the WHS critical regions 1 and
               2 were deleted, and that the BWS imprinted domains (ID) 1 and 2
               were duplicated on the der(4). Parental chromosome analysis
