The Andersson Lab focuses on modeling gene regulation with the ultimate aim to gain insights into molecular mechanisms by which enhancer or promoter dysregulation contributes to disease risk.

We take an interdisciplinary approach and combine machine learning, statistical learning, genetics, and molecular biology to:

- Determine which noncoding sequences act as enhancers, which genes they regulate, and in which cell types they are active
- Learn how the human genome encodes regulatory activity, and predict the impact of regulatory genetic variants

The lab is based in the [Section for Computational and RNA Biology](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/scarb/), Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen.

We are also affiliated with the [Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Genomics Mechanisms of Disease](https://www.broadinstitute.org/nnfc) and the [FANTOM](https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/) consortium.
